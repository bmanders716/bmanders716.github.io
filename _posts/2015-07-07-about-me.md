##Introduction
My name is Brittany Anderson and I am currently a senior New Media 
Communications Major at UNC-Chapel Hill. I'm originally from High 
Point, but I've lived in the Durham-Chapel Hill area for so long that I 
call it my home.

##My Hobbies
I would say that if people talked to me for a while the first thing that 
they would notice about me is that I'm a bit of a geek. I love video games,
animation, and webcomics. I also consider myself an amateur artist.

##Future Plans
Right now I'm concentrating on school and finding a job after I graduate. 
I would like to go back to school and learn how to do IT or art.
