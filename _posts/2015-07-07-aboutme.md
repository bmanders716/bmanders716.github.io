##Introduction

My name is Brittany Anderson and I am currently a senior New Media
Communications Major at UNC-Chapel Hill. I'm originally from 
High Point, but I've lived in the Durham-Chapel Hill area for so long 
that I call it my home.

##Hobbies

I would say that if people talked to me for a while the first thing that
they would notice about me is that I'm a bit of a geek. I love video 
games, animation, and webcomics. I also consider myself an amateur 
artist.

##My Goals

Right now I'm concentrating on school and finding a job after I graduate.
I would like to go back to school and learn how to do IT or art.
