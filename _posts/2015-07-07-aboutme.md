##Introduction

My name is Brittany Anderson and I am currently a senior New Media Communications Major at UNC-Chapel Hill.
I'm originally from High Point, but I've lived in the Durham-Chapel Hill area for so long that I call it
my home.

##Hobbies

I would say that if people talked to me for a while the first thing that they would notice about me is that 
I'm a bit of a geek. I love video games, animation, and webcomics. I also consider myself an amateur artist.
